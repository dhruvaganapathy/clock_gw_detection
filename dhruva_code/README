Documentation for GW Network Response Code

1. compute_complex_response

Purpose: Computes the complex gravitational-wave detector response for a
network of detectors with specified arm orientations and positions.

Parameters: positions (N×3 array): Cartesian positions of detectors.
arms (N×3 array): Unit vectors describing detector arm orientations.
f_gw (float): GW frequency in Hz. A_plus, A_cross (float or complex):
Plus and cross mode GW amplitudes. theta, phi_sky (float): Sky location
of GW source in spherical coordinates. psi (float): GW polarization
angle.

Returns: S: array of complex detector responses.

Physics: - Builds polarization basis. - Constructs polarization
tensors. - Computes detector tensor. - Includes geometric propagation
delay.

2. dual_band_network_response

Purpose: Simulates a dual-frequency gravitational-wave measurement for a
detector network, generating clock-based phase measurements and fitting
sinusoidal modulation.

Parameters: positions, arms: Detector geometry. f_gw1, f_gw2: Two GW
frequencies. N_cycles_1, N_cycles_2: Number of measurement cycles.
A_plus, A_cross: Intrinsic GW amplitudes. theta_sky, phi_sky, psi: GW
source orientation. M_chirp (float): Chirp mass used by signal
generator.

Returns: fits, fits2: Fit results for two frequencies. T_1, T_2: Total
measurement durations. S, S2: Complex detector responses at the two GW
frequencies.

3. dual_band_network_response_analyzer

Purpose: Analyzes the dual-band fit results to reconstruct: - Detector
antenna pattern (complex) - Relative time delays - Amplitude and phase
uncertainties

Parameters: fits: Fit results at f_gw1. fits2: Fit results at f_gw2.

Returns: antenna_response_amp antenna_response_amp_err
antenna_response_phase antenna_response_phase_err time_delay
time_delay_err

Algorithm: - Forms complex fit results A·exp(i·phi) - Computes phase
difference between bands - Converts phase difference to geometric time
delay - Removes delay to extract pure antenna response
